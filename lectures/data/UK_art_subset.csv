The composition and execution of this picture are particularly happy, and full of poetry.  The grouping is full of grace, though the faces are by no means of ideal beauty. On the left wing, St. John the Evangelist, kneeling, blesses the chalice of the New Sacrament; on the right wing, St. John the Baptist, also kneeling, the Lamb by his side, ...prints[?] to the Child, seated at the feet of the Mother on the pillow.

1838,Christie's,"The Adoration of the Kings.  The Portraits of the two brothers, Hubert and Jean, are seen through the opening of a window-casement; Jean is affectionately indicating by his action that it is to his brother Hubert that he is indebted for instruction in his art, and for the fame he has thereby acquired.  Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, is represented as the principal of the Magi.  He is decorated with the order of the Golden Fleece, of which he was the founder.  He has, however, a prouder claim to celebrity in being also the illustrious patron of these distinguished artists, who in return conferred a lustre on his name, and on Bruges, the capital in which the Dukes of Burgundy then held their court.  It is probable also that all of the principal figures in the picture are portraits, as it is finished with a care and precision which denote that it was painted on no ordinary occasion.  The painting is pure and uninjured, and its colouring mellowed and improved in the course of revolving ages.  To Hubert and Jean Van Eycke has been ascribed the invention of painting in oil.  All who behold this painting must at all events allow them the merit of having brought the colours they themselves used or invented to a degree of perfection that has never been surpassed; and indeed we should be puzzled to point out in any painting, of any school or age, tints of more vivid colouring than those that dazzle our eyes in this picture, and which to its other high qualities, adds that of its having outstripped its age in grace and refinement, and of being painted with greater elegance and skill in the disposition of its figures and draperies, and a better knowledge of perspective, than is seen in the works of any other artist of any school, during the long interval that elapsed from the period (at which we may reasonably suppose it to have been painted) down to the first dawn of the Augustan era in painting, when the science was again happily revived by the powerful and nearly contemporaneous efforts (in their several schools) of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Correggio","Hubert Van Eycke.  Born at Maaseyk, on the Meuse, in 1366",Painting,110
1838,Christie's,"The Triumph of Bacchus and Silenus, with a procession of Nymphs, Satyrs, and Bacchanalian attendants, in a glowing Italian landscape rich in poetic feeling, characterising the mode of painting of this most classical artist.  It has much of the freedom of touch and sparkling effect that distinguish a much admired picture by Annibale Carracci formerly in the Orleans Collection",Annibale Carracci,Painting,33
1838,Christie's,"Santo Jacomo di Compostella trampling under his horse's feet the vanquished Moors; the scene is laid in the wildest regions of Gallicia, where mountains piled upon mountains (Ossa upon Pelion) give to it a most imposing effect.  The Warrior-Saint, sword in hand, animated by a divine ardour, displays a countenance of the most heroic intrepidity.  He is mounted on a splendid white charger, whose nostrils breathe fire, and which (with the exception of wings) appears to possess every attribute of the fabulous Pegasus. The poor discomfited Moors are in the most abject state of dejection and despair.  This fine painting records the glories of Spain in former days; and it also furnishes a proof (if any were wanting) of Zurbaran's great merits as an artist, and also of his enthusiastic patriotism",Francisco Zurbaran.  A Spanish Painter. Born in 1596,Painting,45
1838,Christie's,"Nearly the same view [The Grand Canal at Venice], of smaller size.  The scene is less stirring, it not being on a day of festivals, but it is painted with great care, correctness, and truth, and it is also a valuable specimen of this able artist, whose works are unrivalled as the skilful delineator of his own floating city",Antonio Canaletti,Painting,62
1838,Christie's,"Le Depart pour la Chasse.  This is a most charming, sparkling, and highly-finished painting, abounding with subjects; the more prominent of which are a cavalier and his lady richly attired, and the latter about to mount a beautiful Wouverman-like little white horse, apparently well trained and of the greatest docility.  A beggar-woman with children is earnestly relating her tales of woe to a sprightly young page, who appears to be compassionately listening to them and is at the same time holding the bridle of the lady's horse.  This is a masterly production, and has much of the spirit and pencilling of Philip Wouvermans",John Lingelbach,Painting,77

1838,Christie's,"A Group of ten figures, forming a family concert, being the portraits of three generations of the Ponte and Bassano family -- old Francesco, Giacomo, and Francesco the younger, with their wives, &c.  Leandro, who is well known (as he often painted his own portrait), is standing near his wife (who is playing on a Cembalo, or Harpsichord), and is intently overlooking a musical book held by his father, Giacomo, over the head of the old lady.  The subject is a very interesting one; it gives us the portraits of these excellent painters, and is a proof of the harmony that prevailed in their family","Bessano, (Leandro da Ponte)",Painting,64

The subject is taken from one of the Odes of Anacreon; the Latin inscription on the picture is Pungit apis peurum veneris dum roscida mella furatur sic sunt dulcia mixta malis.  The naked figure of Venus, with hat and feathers, and a rich golden necklace, is most correctly and elegantly designed, as is also her action of irony and derision admirably expressed.  The artist has introduced the head of his favourite stag with its widely ramified antlers, (which he so often repeated,) its hinder parts being concealed in the adjoining thicket, and he has also added the coat of arms of the patron, for whom he painted the picture. It is in very fine preservation and a valuable specimen of the master",Lucas Cranach.  Born in 1472,Painting,27

It is a clear bright painting; the different objects in the interior, or library, are designed with the utmost precision, and all its parts are touched with a bold and masterly pencil.

1838,Christie's,"The Sylvan Nymphs.  It is a sort of pasticcio, by this talented artist, who in it has combined the excellences of three great schools: the rich deep harmonious tints of Titian, the poetical graces and classical refinement of Niccolo Poussin being, in this excellent painting, united with the glowing colours of his own great master and prototype, Rubens.  The easel pictures of Gaspar de Crayer are of great rarity: this is a very fine one, and was formerly a very attractive picture in the Le Brun Gallery, where its engraving does not do it justice",Gaspar de Crayer,Painting,84
1838,Christie's,"Christ calling St. Peter.  Painted on copper.  And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.  And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. -- St. Matthew. Christ's figure is very grand and imposing, the two Apostles express a reverential awe for their Divine Master.  The two other brethren, John and James, with their father, Zebedee, are seen in a boat in the distance.  It is a rich and well-painted picture",Francesco Albano,Painting,32
1838,Christie's,"Mary Magdalen in the midst of the Pleasures of the World, or Mary Magdalen's Dance (as the print from this picture is called).  It would be endless to minutely describe the many groups of figures of which this painting is composed, in the midst of which is a cavalier richly dressed in the costume of the day, leading a portly female into scenes of mirth and jollity, that are meant to represent The Pleasures of the World.  There is an etching of this rare picture by the artist himself, which, when it is to be met with, sells for a very high price.  There does not appear to be any date on this picture; but the date, on a stone, of 1531, together with the large L (the monogram of the artist), is nearly in the centre of the etching, and may lead us to suppose that the picture was painted somewhere about that time.  Large church paintings of this esteemed old master are, it is said, occasionally to be met with in Holland and in Germany; but we believe that an easel picture of this size (and of a subject that is the rarest of all Leucas Van Leyden's prints), in unique. Leucas Van Leyden was the contemporary of Albert Durer, in Germany, and of Marc Antonio Raimondi, (the friend of Raphael, and engraver of his works) in Italy, and they formed a triumvirate of the three most eminent engravers of the day, whose works have scarcely ever been surpassed by any modern artists, and are still justly held in very high estimation",Leucas de Leyden.  Born 1494,Painting,35
1838,Christie's,"Queen Mary when a Child.  This is an extraordinary portrait, delineating the features that adhered to that graceless Queen to the last years of her life: it is, however, a faultless work of art, finished like a miniature, the delicacy of execution of which can be fully appreciated only by a magnifying-glass",Hans Holbein,Painting,32
1838,Christie's,"The Story of Narcissus; a smaller picture.  It is of a smaller size than the preceding picture, but its colouring is of the most dazzling description.  Mola, in his more highly finished works nearly approaches the admired landscape-painters of the Bolognese School, to whose manner he super-added the rich and glowing tints he had acquired by an assiduous study, and imitation of the great works of Tizian.  Mola was by birth a Milanese, but he imitated in their turn the works of the most celebrated masters of almost every Italian School of Painting",Pietro Francesco Mola,Painting,17

The soft, sweet, mellow tone of colouring, and knowledge of chiar' oscuro displayed in this painting, are beyond all praise.  All is modesty, repose, and harmony; Carlo Dolce excelled in Scriptural subjects, such as the justly admired painting of Christ holding the Bread of Life, in the Marquess of Exeter's collection; as also in subjects called Ecce Homo, or Sufferings of Christ, the anguish of the Virgin Mary, Martyrdom of Saints, &c.; all of which he depicted with admirable pathos, and a sweetness of expression which was peculiarly his own; but his portraits are of rare occurrence, and this is amongst his finest and highest finished productions in this line of painting",Carlo Dolce,Painting,89

This picture formerly adorned the walls of the Ghigi Palace at Rome; and is thus described in Lady Morgan's Life and Times of Salvator Rosa, where we are told the picture was purchased from Salvator Rosa by Don Maria Ghigi, brother to Pope Alexander VII.;-- L'Umana Fragilita represents a beautiful girl seated on a glass globe; her brow was crowned with flowers, the fairest and the frailest; her arm was filled by a lone infant, which she appeared to caress, while its twin brother, cradled at her feet, was occupied in blowing air-bubbles from a tube; a child somewhat older, was mischievously employed in setting fire to a wreath of flax twined round a spindle; above this group of blooming youth and happy infancy, with wings outspread (spennachiate) and threatening aspect,, hovered the grim figure of death, dictating the following sentence 'Conceptio culpa, nasci poena, vita labor, necosse mori.'

In the centre of the picture, a lady dressed in blue, and mounted on horseback, is on the point of setting out; she is stopping only for a gentleman who is putting on his spurs, whilst a groom holds his beautiful white horse; in that part of the yard, which is uncovered, a beggar, supported by crutches and a wooden leg, is waiting for them, and already extends his hat for charity.

1802,Skinner and Dyke,"The Arrival of Edward the Vth. into London  [The composition offers us five figures, large as life.  -- The young Monarch, just arrived in London, is receiving the Duke of York, his brother, an infant of seven years old -- they are both in the front of the picture embracing.  Behind the King is the Duke of Glocester, his uncle,* [footnote: It is the portrait of Mr. Kemble, who sat for it to the Artist] in armour, and who is leaning on the throne; the faithful Lord Hastings, the Chamberlain, is near him:  and to the right, we see the good and honest, but too weak and credulous Cardinal Bourchier, extending his hands to bless these young Princes, of whose ruin he became the cause] [As Mr. Northcote had painted this subject and the preceding, with much success, for the gallery of Messrs.

The virgin is also there, afflicted and weeping at the approaching dissolution of her husband.  Angels inhabit with them, that holy abode, from which all appearance of luxury is banished, and one of them is kneeling at the foot of the bed, whilst two others, with joined hands, and impressed with awe and respect, are standing behind him.

1802,Skinner and Dyke,"The Tribute Money  [The composition of this picture, is of seven figures as large as life.  On the sea-shore which is scattered with shells, the disciples are standing, except Peter, who is seen in profile, in the fore-part of the picture; he seems to have just drawn the net, and continues on his knee, on the ground, his head turned to look at the piece of money which one of the disciples has just taken out of the fish he holds in his left hand.  The blue drapery in which this last is clad, has partly fallen from his shoulders, so that part of his body is uncovered; behind him a young woman dressed in red, carrying a basket of fish, on her head, stops through curiosity.  In the mean time the other disciples are eagerly pressing forward, to examine the coin, and manifest equal admiration and surprize at the new miracle wrought by our Saviour.  We plainly recognize the portrait of Rubens in the second figure, on the right hand, but ... we frankly confess that we do not consider it as entirely the production of Rubens's pencil]",Rubens,Painting,65
1802,Skinner and Dyke,"A Landscape and Figures  [A Dutch gentleman and his lady, attended by a page, are taking a walk, and on the declivity of a hill crowned with trees, a beggar is asking charity.

She has on her neck, a row of pearls, and two others fastened below her shoulders, falling with elegance on her breast -- in her bosom is seen a rose of the most precious stones, and her girdle is of the like jewels intermixed with pearls.

The right of the picture, is occupied by three cows, two of which are lying down, whilst the other is standing under a tree, to shelter herself from the rain which begins to fall:  a fourth cow, spotted yellow and white, on this side, towards the middle of the picture, is also standing near her calf which is lying down.  The obscurity of the sky and agitation of the trees, upon which the wind blows with fury, announces the violence of the storm.  Upon the right of the picture, a young girl is thrown down by the wind, with a basket of eggs she was carrying, and they are scattered on the grass, whilst a man, whose hat is carried away by the wind, assists to raise her.  On the second ground, a lady mounted upon a white horse, accompanied by a gentleman, is riding with great speed, followed by a servant and a dog out of breath.  On the third ground, we distinguish an edifice and some trees, but the rain and obscurity permit not the eye to penetrate into the distance]",Loutherbourg,Painting,29

1802,Skinner and Dyke,"Landing of Horses from the Dieppe Packet at Brighton  [This work was painted before the breaking out of the war between England and France. At that time, they often brought horses by the packet, from Dieppe to Brighthelmstone, where the artist painted it after nature.  The fore-ground of the picture, presents the view of a shore, covered with different figures, and the sea, with fishing boats and other vessels.  On the left of the picture, advances a young man, leading by the halter, one of the horses just landed, and is followed by another, whom his guide can scarcely manage, being still in the sea, and frightened by the noise of the waves.  Numbers of spectators, are approaching, among whom two gentleman are conversing, and strictly examining the horse just landed.  Near them, a little boy that a dog is fawning upon, holds out his hat for alms; and behind, are a man, and a woman who holds in her arms a child, and an old man leaning upon his stick.  On the same side, is a groom mounted upon a horse that he has been bathing, whilst a fisherman, who seems tired, leans upon one of those turning posts, fixed by the sea-side; near, is a child who has just come out of the water, sitting employed in dressing himself.  In the centre of the picture, are two fishermen, one lying down upon the sand, and the other in boots, drawing his net that he had extended to dry:  he is standing and conversing with a woman who leans upon his shoulder; and near them, a greyhound has leapt into the water, and runs after the first horse that reaches the shore.  On the right of the picture, are seen two other fishermen, upon the shore, one sitting, and the other standing; they have near them, a basket of fish, and a dog who is going off; we distinguish also, on the same side, the Dieppe Packet-boat, and several little boats employed in the landing of the horses.  Already those who have assisted in getting the two horses on shore, are returned to the packet-boat; and we see another, in which is a man, who holds the halter of a third horse, descending into the sea, where he is swimming, and of which the head only is seen on the surface of the water; and farther, another bark is fastened by a rope to the packet, to lead another horse that is going to descend into the sea, and which is already suspended by a pulley]",Sir Fran. Bourgeois,Painting,51
1802,Skinner and Dyke,"Smugglers defeated  [This picture, on the right, offers us the view of the sea agitated, with some fishing smacks; and on the left, an enormous mass of rocks, on this side of which are the smugglers defeated by a detachment of dragoons.  One of them, having been wounded in the action, is in his shirt, sitting on a bale of merchandize, with his uniform lying beside him; and he is supporting himself by leaning on his sabre, with his left arm, whilst another dragoon dresses the wound he has received in his right.  Their horses are in the corner, attached to each other, and guarded by a dragoon who has dismounted.  One of the smugglers, is sitting in the fore-ground of the picture, and dressing his leg, in which he has been wounded; behind him, one of his companions, is seated on a cask of spirits, whilst three others, who are standing together, are engaged in conversation. Not far off, and loaded with smuggled merchandize, are their horses, one of whom is lying dead on the ground, over which the arms of the smugglers, are scattered; on the same side, a dragoon darts with velocity towards the right of the picture where a young Englishman ... is ... seizing the last of the smugglers, who is on a horse, loaded with a large portmanteau, and whose dog flies with fury at the dragoon]",Sir Fran.

1802,Skinner and Dyke,"A Landscape with Gleaners  [The right of the performance, is occupied by some trees, and a small farmhouse, at the door of which, a sportsman has just stopped, with his horse and dogs, and a young woman, accompanied by a child, is bringing him a bason of milk, which she has drawn from a cow that is near her; and on the other side, seated at the foot of a tree, a little boy is eating.  On this side the farm, are some trees, on which is a pigeon-house; and in the fore-ground, a hen and chickens, which she assembles under her wings, frightened at the sight of the dogs, whilst the cock boldly prepares himself to defend them.  Some gleaners, with the corn that they have collected, are on the left, and more retired, on the other side of a piece of water, are some reapers, in a field of corn; an even country forms the background, which continues 'till it is lost in the distance]",Sir Fran.

On the left, is a man leading two mules, upon one of which a woman is seated.  On one side of the second ground, is seen a rugged road, with a man carrying a sack, who is climbing up, and seems suspended between heaven an earth.  On this second ground, which is of a considerable eminence, the eye enjoys the sight of some old firs, near which a man is leading some cattle to graze.  The third ground offers another eminence, which commands this, and is twice as considerable.  In the centre of the picture, between the first and second ground, is seen a man; and to the left, a cultivated country, with fine poplars, and a distance which gives pleasure to the eye]",Pynacker,Painting,13

Bartolomeo,Painting,450
1837,Christie's,"The Murder of the Innocents.  It is traditionally known that the monks of St. Dominic refused this picture, in consequence of its not being of the precise dimensions ordered, and that the painter was obliged to paint a second for their church.  The numerous alterations that have been made during its painting are visible under the colour, and fully authenticate this repetition.  There is in this picture one figure less in the group to the right; it is likewise 18 inches in height and 14 in width less that the one in the Gallery of Bologna, and the brown tints do not approach to blackness",Guido Reni,Painting,260

It was painted for the refectory of the Convent of St. Mark, in which the artist had taken the habit; removed from Florence, in the first revolutionary invasion by the French.

Bartolomeo,Painting,380

Two pastoral figures are seated on the foreground, unconscious of the gatherine storm which the sky on the right hand side of the picture seems to portend.      The middle ground is occupied by Italian buildings, which form a promontory in the landscape;p the centre of which is traversed by a river, issuing from a lake that is seen in the distance.  A Shepherd is leading his cattle along a path that runs between the bold and broken foreground, and these buildings; probably the site of some ancient Roman Villa.
