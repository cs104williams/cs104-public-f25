That site includes several data visualizations and presentations, and it also publishes the raw data that we will use in this project to recreate and extend some of their most famous visualizations.\n",

All of the data they aggregate are published in the [Systema Globalis](https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis/blob/master/README.md). Their goal is \"to compile all public statistics; Social, Economic and Environmental; into a comparable total dataset.\" All data sets in this project are copied directly from the Systema Globalis without any changes.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **You may consult the text, your notes, your lab work, our lecture examples, and the web pages associated with the course web page.  No other resources are permitted.**  You may not search the web, use ChatGPT or similar systems, or any materials other than your own or those provided by the instructors through the course web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **You may discuss these questions and review general concepts from the class materials with the course instructors and TAs.**  While we expect you to develop your solutions independently, we're happy to answer clarification questions, help you interpret Python error messages, offer general debugging advice, review lecture and lab materials, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **You may not discuss this project or your solutions with anyone else until after the final submission deadline.**\n",

    "* **10pm on Friday, Oct 11: Checkpoint.**  You must complete the first 8 questions, and pass the public autograder tests for those parts.  Submitting this checkpoint is worth 5% of your entire project grade.  After you've submitted the checkpoint, you may still change your answers before the project deadline - only your final submission, to the Project 1 assignment, will be graded for correctness. \n",

    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before you begin, execute the cell at the TOP of the notebook to load the provided tests, as well as the following cell to setup the notebook by importing some helpful libraries. Each time you start your server, you will need to execute these cells again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Be sure to consult your [Python Reference](https://cs104williams.github.io/assets/python-library-ref.html)!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete this notebook by filling in the cells provided. For problems asking you to write explanations, you **must** provide your answer in the designated space. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Please be sure to not re-assign variables throughout the notebook.  For example, if you use `max_temperature` in your answer to one question, do not reassign it later on. Otherwise, you will fail tests that you thought you were passing previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project has hidden tests for some parts. That means even though tests may say 100% passed, doesn't mean your final grade will be 100%. We will be running more tests for correctness once everyone turns in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may find some parts of this project challenging.  Keep in mind that a perfect score is not necessary to be highly successful in this class.  Do your best, but please do not worry if you are unable to complete all parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Along those lines, give yourself ample time to think about the material and develop your solutions.  Don't wait until the last minute!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You may add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Be sure to use distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook, but do not reassign to names we have already used in the notebook. Recall, in the file menu you can select `Kernel > Restart Kernel and Run All Cells` to ensure variables you have deleted are not still in the computer's memory and to run everything from scratch.\n"

In the reverse direction, having fewer children may allow families to devote more resources to each child, reducing child mortality.
